## In order to create this "teaching material" GitHub Pages have been used

Feel free to copy or perhaps add improvements for this README file or to the repository in general.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/JeannetteE/UppsalaWorkshop/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. But you can also *Clone* the repo and work on it in an ATOM Editor, and a GitHub Desktop Client.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run a theme from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site and smoothen the the content created in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/JeannetteE/DTU-IKON/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
