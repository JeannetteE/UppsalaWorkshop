# Introduction to Data Science Tools at Uppsala University Library the 11th of January 2018
## – how to clean, share and visualize datasets and search results by use of tools like OpenRefine, GitHub and VosViewer

The main focus of this workshop is to take "dealing with data, working with data and understanding data" down to a level, where *Librarians* can see themselves getting involved and contributing, without being "too much out of our daily comfort zones"
