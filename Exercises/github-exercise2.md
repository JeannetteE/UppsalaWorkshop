## GitHub exercises to work with

1. Login to your GitHub account - https://github.com and create a single, basic website

1. Click at the __+__ sign in the top right corner, next to your profile info
   1. Create a **New Repository**
   1. Follow the steps, and remember a name for your repository
   1. Remember to mark the Readme.md file, before clicking on **save**
   1. Create a new file in your new repository, called **index.md** and write a short text. In order to make the text/layout looks _nice_ it is important to use the Markdown syntax. See more at the Cheat Sheet guide https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/. When the text is _perfect and you are satisfied_ then **save** (commit) the changes <p>
1. in Regards to making the website look nicer you have to click on _Settings_ and **scroll down** to the buttom. First you  need to finalize a few steps to make the website public. This can be done via **the section about Github pages..**
    1. Important to choose __Master Branch__ and click **save**
    1. Choose one of the **standard themes** - a feature (like a CSS stylesheet) that is provided by GitHub<p>

1. **Clone or Download** your Repository unto your own computer via the GitHub Desktop Client - Remember where you save your repository
    1. Open *the Folder* in your *Atom editor*
    1. Add a file, or add more text to your present *README.md file* - i.e. explain what you do (in other words *DOCUMENT* the proces)
    1. Save your changes

1. Open your **GitHub desktop client**
    1. In here you can now open up your *Github repository* from the path, where you saved it ( remember it is a *FOLDER* you need to open,  not a single *FILE*)
    1. You should now be able to see, that you have made some changes that need to be *committed* to your __Master Branch__

1. Try the same process once more where you open up the repository in your *ATOM Editor* - add some changes and finally *commit* to your __Master Branch__

1. Final exercise will be to work with the feature **Fork**

    1. Open up our special Uppsala GitHub repository at  https://github.com/JeannetteE/UppsalaWorkshop

    1. Click at **FORK** in the top right corner, and save a copy of the Repository - incl all the assignments, the agenda, the dataset and such
    1. You can now provide *new info suggestions*, change errors/mis-spellings or just Add a new file to the repository (sharing/collaboration)
        1. Change and add some new text, a picture og a new file (either via GitHub.com or by using the GitHub desktop client/ATOM editor
        1. **SAVE** ( commit changes ) and create a **Pull request** to the Repository
        1. Jeannette will try to manage to  **accept** your changes little by little (or at least one before the day ends)
