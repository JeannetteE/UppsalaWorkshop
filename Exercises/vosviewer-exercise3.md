## Vosviewer Bonus assignments

You need to search for the data you like to look at - it could be a topic you know well, then the visualization might be easier to understand and work with.

### from Web of Science to VosViewer

1. Choose WoS Core Collection and perform a search of your choice - could be **Open Access articles from Uppsala University** from 2010-2018

1. Save the search as *Full Record and Cited References option*  
- VosViewer works with saved files in **plain text** and **tab-delimited format**.
According to some guidelines **tab-delimited format** is to prefer

1. Then download the *savedrecs.txt* file and save it for later.
Remember that WoS only allows to *download 500 records* at the time, therefore you might need to save in several files.

1. Open VosViewer and *create a MAP* with the results (multiple files works too) - chooose the second option (out of three possible maps)
- Try some of the different parameters, add different colors and finally save the results

1. Perform a similar search - from Scopus, and repeat the procedure, but by *creating map number 3*
- and follow the path to a nice visualization..

1. __SAVE__ the result and upload the file to your Github repository, just because you can :)
